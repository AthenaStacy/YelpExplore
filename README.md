# YelpExplore
This is a set of python Jupyter notebooks which reads in Yelp review data, performs basic NLP on that data, and performs a linear regression model to predict a business' star rating based upon the text of their Yelp reviews.  This functionaltiy is also wrapped
into a web app where a user can input the site of any Yelp page.  The web app then scrapes that Yelp page and uses the model to predict the star rating for the business.
