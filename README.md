# YelpExplore
This is a set of python scripts and Jupyter notebooks to predict the Yelp star rating of a business.  It reads in Yelp review data, puts the data into pandas dataframes, and performs basic NLP on that data. It finally performs a linear regression model to predict a business' star rating based upon the text of their Yelp reviews.  This functionaltiy is also wrapped into a web app where a user can input the site of any Yelp page.  The web app then scrapes that Yelp page and uses the model to predict the star rating for the business.
